A 2D arcade space shooter built using C# in the Unity Game Engine. You control a space ship that shoots at incoming alien ships while avoiding incoming lasers!

This project was made following a hands-on course by Jonathan Weinberger. Many additional features added to apply what I've learned and add my own ideas to it.
